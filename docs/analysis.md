# Analysis
In this file we describe the data and analyze it.

# Heat Map
We created a heat map using Seaborn to show the correlation between the sensor data in type1.csv.

The color of each cell represents the correlation value:
- Dark purple (close to -1): Strong negative correlation (as one sensor increases, the other decreases).
- White (close to 0): No correlation (the two sensors are independent).
- Light orange (close to 1): Strong positive correlation (both sensors increase or decrease together).
