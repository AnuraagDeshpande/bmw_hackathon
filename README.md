# Libraries and tools we used:
Our main tools in this project were different python libraries on which the code depends as well as github for collaborative work.
## Python libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Pytorch
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
   
# Files:
- cleaner.py
This file cleans data of null values and separates it according to part type, while also saving intermediate results into a new file
- plotter.py
This file plots data produced by cleaner. Needed for presentation.
# Our workflow with this project:
At first we cleaned the data. There were a lot of null values which we had to deal with. Then we normalized the data and split it
into several files according to the type of the part.
